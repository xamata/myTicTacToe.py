# myTicTacToe.py
Creating a fully functional TicTacToe game with score counter and board game resets. Uploaded a rough draft of the working game, came across some bugs and noticed defects from a lack of planning. Will go through to refine the code to be less redudant.


Created Pseudocode for the TicTacToe game I'm going to be building. This is my first time attempting pseudocode, it really helped me understand how the game will play out before I even started coding. I'm very confident my code implementation will be smoother with this pseudocode file to refer to.
