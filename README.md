Creating a fully functional TicTacToe game with score counter and board game resets. Will update tomorrow for I have work very soon, need that sweet green block for the day.


Created Pseudocode for the TicTacToe game I'm going to be building. This is my first time attempting pseudocode, it really helped me understand how the game will play out before I even started coding. I'm very confident my code implementation will be smoother with this pseudocode file to refer to.
